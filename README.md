# FYP (For Your Productivity) For LAHacks2021
Student wellness has been greatly impacted with COVID-19. It has become more difficult to be productive and find time in our day to do basic things like drink water or workout. As students ourselves, we find that the most distracting thing is our phone. The time that would usually be used to walk across campus or to get food is now wasted browsing through social media, watching videos, and playing mobile games. Our app aims to solve these problems by banning distracting apps and rewarding students with screen time if they have been productive or completed wellness activities like drinking water and being active. 

## What it does
Our app, FYP - For Your Productivity, is an app designed to promote student wellness and productivity. Below are the features:

**Ban Apps**
Our app allows users to ban certain apps that they are often distracted by. 

**Rewards Productivity and Well-Being**
The app will reward the user if they are productive or do things that benefit their well-being like drinking water and being active. With positive actions, the user gains minutes to expend when they want to relax. 

**Relaxation Periods**
To relax, the user simply goes into the “Cash Out” screen and clicks the start button, which will unban all of their apps and start a countdown timer that subtracts from the total number of minutes they have gained thus far. 

**Notifications**
The user will receive notifications when the countdown timer reaches 5 minutes and 1 minute to remind them of their time left. A notification will also be sent when there is no more time left. This notification informs the user that the apps will now be blocked and it is time to be productive!

**Long-Term Benefits**
Our app assists our users to cultivate proper habits. By encouraging productivity, our app helps our users break bad habits and reinforce good habits. 

**Persistence**
In our app, the timer and the apps selected to ban are persisted. Therefore, if the user closes the app during the countdown, the timer will still keep going. And if the user starts multiple timers, it will always ban the same apps
